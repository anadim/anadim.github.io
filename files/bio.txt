Dimitris Papailiopoulos is an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Sciences (by courtesy) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, a faculty fellow of the Grainger Institute for Engineering, and a faculty affiliate at the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery. 

His research interests span machine learning, information theory, and distributed systems, with a current focus on communication-efficient training algorithms and coding-theoretic techniques that guarantee robustness during model training and inference. 

Between 2014 and 2016, Dimitris was a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley and a member of the AMPLab. Dimitris earned his Ph.D. in ECE from UT Austin in 2014, under the supervision of Alex Dimakis. In 2007 he received his ECE Diploma and in 2009 his M.Sc. degree from the Technical University of Crete, in Greece. 

Dimitris is a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award (2019), two Sony Faculty Innovation Awards (2019, 2020), the Benjamin Smith Reynolds Award for Excellence in Teaching (2019), the IEEE Joint Communications Society/Information Theory Society Best Paper Award (2020), and the IEEE Signal Processing Society, Young Author Best Paper Award (2015). 

In 2018, he co-founded MLSys, a new conference that targets research at the intersection of machine learning and systems. In 2018 and 2020 he was program co-chair for MLSys, and in 2019 he co-chaired the 3rd Midwest Machine Learning Symposium.
